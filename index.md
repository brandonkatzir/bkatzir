## Welcome to My Page

Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor and a Digital Services Librarian at Oklahoma State University. Here's a little information about my work life:
* At OSU, I work in the Edmon Low library and am responsible for managing our open access journals and helping to keep our online databases up and running
* I've published widely in Jewish studies and English, focusing especially on medieval Jewish rhetoric, nineteenth-century Jewish writing in English, and issues relating to English-language style and lexicography. Lately, I've been looking at computational methods of lexicographic research as well as using corpora and text mining in lexicography
* Currently, I have a couple of ongoing article/book projects in the works: my article on nineteenth-century Jewish publisher and community leader, Isaac Leeser is forthcoming in *Jewish History*. I'm also writing these days on lexicography and style. I have a forthcoming article in *Rhetorica* on the history of style guides, and I'm also writing an article exploring the relationship between lexicography and information science
* I'm working on the beginning stages of a couple of digital humanities projects I'm really excited about, *Mapping Tanya* and the [*Victorian Jewish Writers Project*](http://victorianjewishwritersproject.org), both of which I hope to talk more about on my blog, [katzir.xyz](http://katzir.xyz)
* I'm working on becoming a certified [Capentries](https://carpentries.org/) instructor, and I'm excited about leading some coding workshops both at OSU and virtually in other communities, as well
* I spend most of my free time working on the daf yomi and learning more about R
