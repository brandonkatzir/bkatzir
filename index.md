## Welcome to My Page

I’m an Assitant Professor and a Digital Services Librarian at Oklahoma State University. Here's a little information about my work life:
* I spent the first part of my career researching the history of rhetoric, especially in the Jewish and Muslim textual traditions. I’ve been published in top venues like *Rhetoric Society Quarterly*, *Rhetoric*a, and *Philosophy & Rhetoric*
* Currently, I have a couple of ongoing article/book projects in the works: my article on nineteenth-century Jewish publisher and community leader, Isaac Leeser is forthcoming in *Jewish History*. I'm also writing these days on lexicography and style. I have a forthcoming article in *Rhetorica* on the history of style guides, and I'm also writing an article exploring the research habits of lexicographers 
* I'm working on two Yiddish-language projects, one on Yiddish author and essayist Chava Rosenfarb and the other on Yiddish playwright Jacob Gordin
* I'm also working on the beginning stages of a couple of digital projects I'm really excited about, *Mapping Tanya* and the [*Victorian Jewish Writers Project*](http://victorianjewishwritersproject.org), both of which I hope to talk more about on my blog, [katzir.xyz](http://katzir.xyz)
* As for future projects, I'm very interested in continuing to research and write about early Jewish texts in English, especially early translations of the siddur, early rabbinical writing in English, and Jewish periodicals in English. I'm also progressively interested in computational lexicography and text mining with R
* I'm working on becoming a certified [Capentries](https://carpentries.org/) instructor 
* I spend most of my free time working on the daf yomi and R
